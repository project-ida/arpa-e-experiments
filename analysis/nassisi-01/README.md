# Nassisi 1
### April 4, 2025-June 6, 2025 
## Summary
A Pd wire was coiled and loaded into a chamber pressurized with deuterium gas at 2.22 bar above atmospheric pressure. The wire was monitored in the deuterium environment for 30 days, at which point the deuterium was evacuated. After repressurizing the chamber with deuterium, we exposed the wire to laser treatment with a frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG pulsed laser for one hour. The laser treatment was repeated daily for 30 days.

## Results
No thermal or radioactive anomalies were detected. [RESULTS OF CR-39 ANALYSIS]
