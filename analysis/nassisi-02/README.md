# Nassisi 2
### April 4, 2025-April 14, 2025 
## Summary
A Pd wire was coiled and loaded into a chamber pressurized with deuterium gas at 2.20 bar above atmospheric pressure. The wire was to be monitored in the deuterium environment for 30 days, however, several days after the beginning of the soaking period, a leak in the chamber was discovered, and the run was aborted. 

## Results
No thermal or radioactive anomalies were detected. The change in weight of the wire after the soaking period implied a loading to roughly 0.31  D/Pd.
