# Mastromatteo 4
### July 17, 2025-August 1, 2025 
## Summary
A Pd thin film on a silicon chip was loaded as received from Mastromatteo into a chamber pressurized with hydrogen gas at 0.50 bar above atmospheric pressure. We then illuminated the chip with 1.14 mW of 633 nm light from a HeNe laser, with the spot expanded to 8.9 mm diameter to cover the whole sample. The laser illumination ran continuously for two weeks. 

## Results
No thermal or radioactive anomalies were detected. [RESULTS OF SURFACE VIEWER/CR-39 ANALYSIS]
