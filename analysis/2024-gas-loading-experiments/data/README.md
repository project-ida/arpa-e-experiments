# Data

Most of the experimental data is stored in a database whose interface is accessed at http://nucleonics.mit.edu/data/NAME-OF-EXPERIMENT. Data can be pulled directly from there into notebooks for analysis.

For the cases where data is not available from the database, CSV files will be stored in this folder.
